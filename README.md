# mini-chess
Python porgram to play a basic version of chess/checkers with the computer. This was originally written ~2016 before I knew how to use git. Uploading it to a repo a little late.

## Premise of the game

The game is pretty basic, there are only pawns and they can only move one square at a time. It's closer to checkers, except without the ability to take more than one piece in a row
or to turn pieces into more powerful players by reaching the end of the board. You can select the size of the board, and the computer will play you until someone wins
or the program is stopped/errors out.
